 chirno.5.d:0 "A long time has passed since our forces stopped Spanish colonization of the sub-Saharan region. But our past leaders didn't make a great effort to improve their lives and destroyed and burned everything piece of culture so they could stop rebelling, and of course, they want to take revenge against us even if they don't have anything left. But Chirno IX of gensokyo has a very great idea to stop the extremism and violence in those regions and thus she will start by apologizing about it and fix what our past made, promising that she will make a better future for everyone."

Half an hour pass and she brought the subject about the recent terrorist acts in the sub-Sharan region and Somalia and one way to fix it is changing our policies on religion, Chirno also has discussed that the future of the country will be bright and united for a better world."

 chirno.22.t:0 "Backstory of Chirno IX"
 chirno.22.d:0 "The frist chirno, "Chirno I of Gensokyo" in 1441 opened the frist gate to this world connecting the "earth" to another dimension where magic was a common thing and all beings from fantasies tales were real, she calls it gensokyo and being on "earth" she is the strongest one, she also conquered the little village that was near of the gate and claimed the lands while slowly conviced people to support his ideas of a new era. The deal was that she just went to this place called "earth" just for fun and sometimes to test his powers but everytime she came to "earth" she had a different persona everytime so their people didn't think she was the same all the time. Now that Chirno IX of Gensokyo arrived to his country she decided to spend the rest of time here until she perfects his "World Freezer", an ability that can potentally freeze an entire planet."
 chirno.22.a:0 "I hope this explains a little about this mod."

 spain.771.t:0 "Chirno claims our lands from africa!"
 spain.771.d:0 "A leader called "Chirno" has sended us a concerning letter telling us to surrender our territories from africa, if we comply then we will not have a war but if we reject, they will fight for it, what should we do."

 spain.771.b:0 "Why should we surrender so easily?"

 chirno.24.d:0 "It seems that after our recent change of politics in our country has enraged some people to the boiling point, that won't gonna make change us to how we were back and if they really want that, they will have to fight!"
 chirno.24.a:0 "Are they sure this is a good idea?"

 chirno.29.t:0 "We haven't done anything to fix this issue."
 chirno.29.d:0 "What is Chirno IX doing? She fully knows that we have a problem in our country but she refuses to do anything! This is outrageous, this is insane it feels like you are doing this on purpose, what are you trying to achieve because it feels like you want this country to collapse don't you?\n\n§RBy the end of the year if you haven't done the frist focus you'll play as Rumia the Youkai of Darkness§!"
 chirno.29.a:0 "Are you sure this is the best option?"
 ####aya-events####
 chirno.40.t:0 "Create a news story!"
 chirno.40.d:0 "Aya:"I usually don't need the help of anyone to make an article but such words don't come from a fairy that often.\n\nChirno:Well what i'm saying is true and if you don't wanna come to my world then you are not invited. After all i could make a better news articles than yours and i would call it chichimiru's newspaper official! The most truthful newspaper out there!\n\nAya:Too much talk coming from you that at this point that you made me interested to see what you say is true. I will see if it is worth making an article as maybe i do have some time to spare."\n\nYour goal is to create a news article in which Aya has to be impressed with it, after doing a succesful news article Aya will be available to recruit into your country.\n\n§RRemember that making a really STUPID news article will remove a lot of PP and Aya won't help you on your journey until you convince her§!"
 chirno.40.a:0 "Put a mysterious tone to it!"
 chirno.40.b:0 "It needs lots of action!"
 chirno.40.c:0 "Maybe a little of drama."
 chirno.41.t:0 "But what will the subject be?"
 chirno.41.d:0 "Now with that in mind, let's do something that we can combine with what we have selected, maybe about how powerful chirno really is or maybe even something that she likes to do! well whatever you have in mind remember that you have to make it look interesting......atleast enough so we can recruit her....sorry i mean to convice her to join our party!"
 chirno.41.a:0 "About freezing frogs!"
 chirno.41.b:0 "About how to cook ice."
 chirno.41.c:0 "About the history of Chirno's Republic."
 chirno.441.t:0 "Mysterious Frogs"
 chirno.441.d:0 "A strange and inexplicable rain of frogs is rumored to occur only once every century in which it takes the inhabitants by surprise. Nobody ever anticipates when a rain of frogs will occur and the truth is that you'll have to be lucky to see one although it is not a good thing since these frogs come very angry and tend to attack humans, For this reason Chirno III of Gensokyo prepared a special ice fairy brigade to freeze the frogs charged with rage and protect the people. And from the years and years that brigade became a defense system that has all the cities since nobody never knows when it will happen again."
 chirno.441.a:0 "That's spooky"
 chirno.442.t:0 "The mystery of cooking ice"
 chirno.442.d:0 "Cooking ice is surely a mystery or just plain stupid, how does one even cook ice? Well surely Chirno could explain that to us...right?\n\n§B"Of course! The frist thing you need is to put a big block of ice on the frying pan while you put salt over it. Then you melt the ice cube until there's only a fine water. Then you just put in the refrigerator and wait some hours and you now have Cooked ice! isn't awesome?"§!\n\n§RHuh that's kinda stupid i'm sorry to say that but i actually don't know what to say....§!\n\n§BYou are so impressed that you don't know what to say! I win again then.§!\n\n§RI'm sorry but you have to make something more interesting than that.§!"
 chirno.442.a:0 "Aya's not interested, try again!"
 chirno.443.t:0 "A mystery of a country called "Chirno Republic""
 chirno.443.d:0 "Chirno republic even the frist day of it's existance it's filled with mystery and questions, like why are all the Chirnos from I to IX look oddly similar?\n\n The only thing we know is that whenever a new Chirno appeared a big blizzard would storm the main city that she called "Gensokyo" and that happens everytime a new one Chirno appears. \n\nCurious thing is when the a Chirno leaves they always selects a substitute president so they can keep control of it while she is gone and when that happens it's normally called the intermedi period.\n\n Anyways so much mystery is hiding but people see her as a goddess come to life because i mean who else in this world can actually freeze other people with their bare hands?"
 chirno.443.a:0 "Aya's is interested, nice job!"
 chirno.444.t:0 "Freezing frogs is full time job now!"
 chirno.444.d:0 "One of Chirno's favourites activities is freezing frogs and she eventually made it into a brigade of elite fairies to dedicate to freeze frogs and to help local villages and big cities.\n\nThe Frogs Freezers always are prepared for any sudden attack of frogs and are ready to fight to protect their people and nobody knows when will the rain of frogs happen again but when the time comes, They will be ready and so our elite fairy brigade!"
 chirno.444.a:0 "Aya's is not interested, try again!"
 chirno.445.t:0 "Cooking ice and it's consequences!"
 chirno.445.d:0 "Cooking can be exciting, it can be emotional even a little touching too but most importantly is how you do it, of course if you don't know how to cook you should learn how to do it if not how are you going to survive.\n\nWell cooking ice is one of the frist steps and you ask yourself "What does it mean to cook ice?" and let me tell you that this is not a simple as it sounds.\n\nFrist we add a frying pan alright? Then we take ice cubes and put it on the frying pan, while the ice is cooking we put salt over it and now we hope it doesn't explode (if you are using gunpowder ice of course).\n\nNow that the ice is melted and we didn't forget to add a little of sugar (it's an important step) we take it out of the frying pan and put it on the refrigerator and wait until it's frozen(Ice cool!).\n\nYou are wondering what are you doing with your life at this point and let me tell you........(I don't know too!)but this part is important, get the now iced ice and put it in a bowl and take the power of the sun to MELT it again, yes melt it again and when it's done you are done you can drink it now!"
 chirno.445.a:0 "Aya's is interested, nice job!"
 chirno.446.t:0 "Chirno's Republic The country that changed history."
 chirno.446.d:0 "Chirno's Republic already has some centuries being a powerful country as it pushed out a lot of european invaders out of the continent at least at the south part of africa.\n\nBut as like most countries it's starts small in the end of the congo river when a sudden and inexplicable blizzard stormed everything in it's pass. Soon as the blizzard started to dissipate a city out of nowhere appeared and there she was, Chirno I of Gensokyo she proclaimed herself, and thus she prepared an army and started expanding deep in the middle of congo forest, the natives in the region were impressed and other were outraged and soon a more than 200 years struggle to assimilate the region commence.\n\nNow we are in 1936 and Chirno's Republic still has scars from the past, will Chirno show that she is the strongest or will this story end."
 chirno.446.a:0 "Aya's is interested, nice job!"
 chirno.447.t:0 "The frogs of the lake."
 chirno.447.d:0 "It's a beatiful day outside, birds are singing, flowers are blooming, on days like this frogs were being frozen by Chirno, and i ask her "How many frogs did you freeze today?" and she responded with "I didn't count how many...", Seeing Chirno freezing frogs was really the good old times but now she cares more about being the strongest and doing stuff like taking control of a country or an army i still don't get half of the things she says. Maybe she is just more than a fairy at this point..."
 chirno.447.a:0 "Aya's is not interested, try again!"
 chirno.448.t:0 "The Secrets of cooking Ice."
 chirno.448.d:0 "Once you put ice in the frying pan you can't go back, now you must finish what you started, cooking ice is not something to joke about because if you make a mistake it can cost your life, gunpowder ice is no joke.\n\nCooking ice can be stressful and can be life-changing for someone unfamiliarized with the subject, You start by putting ice in the frying pan then you heat it until it's only water, then put salt over it and put it inside the refrigerator until it frozen, then get it outside and use the power of the sun to melt it but be very cautious."
 chirno.448.a:0 "Aya's is interested, nice job!"
 chirno.449.t:0 "What is Chirno's Republic?"
 chirno.449.d:0 "Chirno's republic is definitely a weird country if we compare it with others, and thats what it makes it unique, and with the incredible strength of all the Chirnos from one to nine, they all have fought incredible hard to get where we are right now.\n\nAfter all this time, this country and all the wars that it had fought against the europeans, it's still around and it will still around for the time to come. But it feels like there's something that we haven't been told..."
 chirno.449.a:0 "Aya's is interested, nice job!"
 ####That's quite a lot :)####
 chirno.80.t:0 "The youkai of darkness."
 chirno.80.d:0 "Rumia has the ability of manipulating darkness. By covering herself in pure darkness, she is able to prevent sunlight from passing through the darkness, as it is magical in nature and can render even traditional lights such as torches useless within it. Because of this, people who happen to go inside the darkness would not able to see anything, but it looks like Rumia herself is also less capable to see, as she might crash into trees while flying."
 chirno.80.a:0 "A surprise to be sure but a welcome one."
 chirno.81.t:0 "A night full of sparrows."
 chirno.81.d:0 "Mystia Lorelei is a night sparrow with an outgoing egocentric personality, at least she sounds arrogant, that enjoys infusing confusion and terror into the hearts of humans using her ability: a song that creates confusion in those who hear her. Her song seems to attract nearby monsters as well. Something that Night Sparrow also possess in real legends, it is an ability to inflict night-blindness on the opponent."
 chirno.81.a:0 "I'm trying to sleep would you stop singing?"
 chirno.82.t:0 "A swarm of night bugs."
 chirno.82.d:0 "Wriggle possesses the ability to freely manipulate insects of most varieties, where it's unclear if this power is limited to only certain insects. She is seen manipulating various types of fireflies, as well as moths. While individual bugs may be quite weak, this ability can be used to call on entire swarms of them, including poisonous insects like deadly hornets; when she gets serious, she's also able to summon a swarm of harvest mites, insects so small that they are invisible to the naked eye and are the most dangerous bugs, that can bite without detection and infect humans with fatal diseases. She can also direct a swarm of night bugs big enough to mark specific targets for our bombers at night."
 chirno.82.a:0 "Keep the lights out please i can't see a thing!"
 chirno.83.t:0 "Chirno's personal assistant."
 chirno.83.d:0 "Like other fairies, she is cheerful and mischievous, down to earth and emotional. What they don't know is that Daiyousei is Chirno's personal bodyguard with a very heavy and offensive melee attacks that even taking guard will not guarantee your safety and some might think that she could even fight Chirno, but they have been friends for a long time and with the combination of strength of these 2 fairies it is for sure that nobody will be able to defeat them."
 chirno.83.a:0 "You better not fool while Daiyousei is here."
 chirno.600.t:0 "Mysterious mist appears..."
 chirno.600.d:0 "Since some days we have recently caught wind from something bizzare, a purple fog appearing near the capital, not a thick fog but it's quite remarkable and it's concerns us greatly because we don't know what it is and what is going to happen next!\n\nOur glorious leader Chirno, i feel this is not something we should ignore, the fog greatly covers the sunlight but atleast it doesn't expands that much so we do have time to act.\n\nThere's rumors that people have seen a very big building inside the fog but we can't remark how big it is or what even is just that is very big, a recent exploration into the fog result into a weird situation, at first the explorers couldn't tell where they were going, they were confused at their current location and when they found someone suddenly they were outside of the fog in the blink of an eye they also had a message to send to you, they couldn't tell who told them about it but the message says: §RExpect a visit soon.§!"

 chirno.601.d:0 "In the middle of the night 2 individuals approach the Chirno governmental building, there were at the entrance when suddenly the dissapeared out of sight it feelt like they were never there, soon before the shift ends there's a knock in the door, Chirno jumped from the chair without expecting nobody at this hour. When Chirno opened the door she had chill in the spine.\n\nWhen she tried to see who was on the other side she felt weird knowing their faces in such place, they were The Scarlet Devil ("Remilia Scarlet") and ("The maid of Scarlet Mansion") Sakuya Izayoi.\n\n§ROh look who is here, it's the baka ice fairy from the lake, that explains why we haven't see you in a long time, doesn't mean i miss you...§!\n\nAnd what are YOU doing here you childish vampire? And you also bring your entire mansion here!?

 chirno.620.d:0 "She essentially takes the position of managing the Scarlet Devil Mansion.She was not born in Gensokyo, and the name "Sakuya Izayoi" was given to her by Remilia Scarlet.\n\nSakuya tends to be a little spacey, but it's unknown if its just an act. She's polite and pleasant towards to her mistress Remilia Scarlet and those she's close with, such as Patchouli Knowledge, while being less formal with other people. With those she's frequently annoyed with, such as Marisa Kirisame, she can be somewhat harsh and direct with her insults and smack-talk, especially during duels. She seems to possess a wry wit and delivers comebacks stoically.\n\nAs the head maid, she oversees all the fairy maids as the only human maid.\nThe other maids have many perks to their jobs and rarely choose to leave (even though they are not paid or given vacations); however, they are nearly useless and most of the work is done by Sakuya alone, which would be impossible if she didn't stop or slow time. She shops at the Human Village, but she is cold toward other humans and has no friends there. However, ever since Remilia Scarlet was beaten by the heroine of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, Sakuya has begun opening herself up more. "

She's friends with the mistress of the house, Remilia Scarlet, and acts as resident librarian. She's known as a highly capable, experienced, and studious magician, usually found researching the countless tomes within the house library. But her great abilities are offset by her poor health, caused by long-time reclusivity and asthma.\n\nShe doesn't have a very proactive personality, but rather always walks her own path. However, she's always interested where knowledge is concerned and will proactively go and try to acquire it. She does everything by the book, but still makes a lot of mistakes. She's also described as very dark and taciturn, which in this case means she is introverted and silent in expression and manner. "

She is known for her mastery of the martial arts, part of which can be seen in her movement which is based on Bajiquan, such as Shin-Kyaku and Tetsuzanko.\n\nMeiling is very laid-back, which sometimes gets her into trouble, and is known to sleep on the job.(Although she does her job when needed.) She regularly receives challengers and is a worthy opponent of the strong. She is not outwardly aggressive towards humans, except those who attempt to trespass on the grounds of Scarlet Devil Manor, though it seems the only humans who trespass are powerful enough to defeat her in the first place.

She's also the older sister (and guardian) of Flandre Scarlet.\n\nWhile she tries to cultivate the image of a mysterious and frightening vampire aristocrat, Remilia is as childish as her appearance suggests. However, she is surprisingly polite. Her long lifetime has only served to make her prone to boredom and as a result she prizes anything she finds novel Remilia is respected by most youkai of Gensokyo and so she's said to have a charismatic personality.\n\nHowever, in reality this is only because of the fear they have for her kind. While she can act in an overblown and grandiose fashion, she usually only does it during incidents or for important matters. Otherwise, she tends to exhibit childish behavior"
